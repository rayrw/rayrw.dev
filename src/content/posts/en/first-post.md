This is my first blog post — partly to test if my blog setup is working, and partly to say a genuine "Hello, World!"

My name is Ray. I’ve been working as a Software Engineer specializing in frontend web development for the past few years. Along the way, I’ve solved many problems, but I’ve realized I haven’t had a personal space to document and share those solutions. Outside of the company I work for, I don’t really have a place to define who I am or showcase what I’ve built. If I had written down the problems I solved, maybe those posts could have helped others facing the same issues.

Recently, I attended JSNation and React Summit in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Everyone I met was incredibly kind. For the first time, I felt like I was truly part of the web development community. I want to deepen that sense of connection and meet more people who are passionate about the same work.

Cool! Nice to meet you — I’m excited to connect with more people!
